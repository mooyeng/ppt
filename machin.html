            <strong>Intimate Politeness Level -반말</strong>
          </h3>
          <p class="indent" align="justify">
            The intimate politeness level (반말 banmal) is widely used in everyday Korean, but mostly between close
            friends
            who are in the same age group or by an older person talking to a younger person. Younger people also
            sometimes
            use the intimate politeness level when talking to older people, typically family members or people who have
            agreed to be on closer terms with each other. The intimate politeness level is a conjugation used at the end
            of verbs to convey the amount of politeness the speaker holds towards the listener.

            This makes a standard verb (descriptive or action) 존댓말, honorific speech. We don't necessarily only use it

            of

          <p class="indent" align="justify">
            To make a verb honorific, take the verb stem, and add -시 or -(으)시. This is now the honorific form of the

          <strong>Irregular으Verbs:아프다Conjugations</strong>
          <br>

          <p class="indent" align="justify">
            We conjugateverbs that end with the vowel -으 differently than other verbs when the conjugation starts with a
            vowel. Essentially, we replace 'ㅡ' with the vowel that starts the conjugation. When the conjugation starts
            with a consonant, we conjugate the verb as normal. The conjugation must start with a vowel. In addition, the
            verb must end with the '으' vowel, and not with a consonant for this irregular conjugation to take place. For
            example, we conjugate the verb 늦다 (neutda), "to be late" in English, as normal.
          </p>

          <p class="indent" align="justify">
            Additionally, there is an irregular conjugation when the verb that is being conjugated has two or more
            syllables, and the vowel in the syllable immediately preceding the '으' syllable is either '아' or '오.' Thus,
            the preceding syllable affects the conjugation. Instead of determining which conjugation to use according to
            으
            (which would be typically be a 어 conjugation), the verb is conjugated as if '아' or '오' was the determining
            vowel (which would be typically be a 아 conjugation).

          </p>

          <p class="indent" align="justify">
            The conjugation is identical to the intimate politeness level (아/어/여) and standard politeness level
            (아/어/여요).
            These stay in their respective politeness levels.

          <p class="indent" align="justify">We do not use the formal politeness imperative often in casual spoken
            Korean,
            or even in formal situations. We generally reserve it for people of extreme importance (i.e. Kings, Queens,
            Royalty, Presidents, High-ranking military officials, etc.).</p>
          <p class="font-italic indent" align="justify">*Often, we can find the written form (으)시오 on signs on the
            street,
            giving warning or directions to the public. The spoken version of this can be found in many historical
            Korean
            dramas as well, however, its use is only relegated to written Korean in modern Korean.</p>

            use it to welcome customers when they enter a store, restaurant, or an office. Typically, customers don't
            respond to greeting. In response, saying 안녕하세요 (annyeonghaseyo, or "hello" in English) can even be too
            polite;
            but to acknowledge the person that has greeted the customer, most people will simply nod their head.
            However,
            it is not considered rude to ignore this greeting as well since it stays more like formality.</p>

            <strong>Express Ability, Capability, or Possibility:ㄹ/을수있다</strong>
          </h3>
          <br>
          <p class="indent" align="justify">
            -ㄹ/을 수있다 (-l/eul ssu itta) is a grammatical structure we use to express ability, capability, or possibility
            (i.e., whether you can or can't speak English, or you can or can't use a computer, etc.). This structure
            adds
            on to the end of both descriptive and action verbs to express the possibility or capability of that verb. We
            can translate it as "can," or "able to." The word 수(su) in this structure means "a way," "a method," or "a
            possibility," thus making the entire structure express possibility or ability.
          </p>
          <p class="indent" align="justify">
            We can conjugate the last verb 있다 (itta) to express politeness level, tense, and mood. Traditionally, the
            verb
            can inflect negation as well, but in this grammatical structure the negated form would come from the verb
            opposite the verb 있다 (itta), which is 없다 (eoptta). We can translate the construction -ㄹ/을 수 없다 (-l/eul ssu
            eoptta) as "cannot" or "not able to." However, when using the construction ㄹ/을 수 없다 (l/eul su eopda), it
            carries the notion that the speaker (or subject of the sentence) was unable to do something because they did
            not have the capacity to perform that activity. Using this structure implies that the subject does not
            possess
            the ability to perform that action. For example, 먹을 수 없어, which means "I can't eat," in English, implies "I
            don't have the ability to eat." When expressing "can't" because of factors other than inability, we use the
            impossibility adverb 못 (mot) instead.
          </p>
          <p class="indent" align="justify">We use ㄹ/수 있다, ㄹ/ 수 없다 for verbs ending with vowels. And use -을 수 있다/없다 with
            verb stems ending in consonants.
            <br><br>
            하다 = 할 수 있다 / 할 수 없다.
            <br>
            먹다 = 먹을 수 없다 / 먹을 수 있다.
